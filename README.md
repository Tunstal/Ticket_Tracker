## About

This this is a web application that uses Laravel, Inertia.js, and Vue.js to create a simple CRUD application. The application is a ticket system that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tickets. The application also has a user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and logout. The application uses Laravel's built-in authentication system to handle user authentication.

Vue.js is used to create the frontend of the application. Inertia.js is the API that connects the frontend to the backend. Inertia.js allows the frontend to interact with the backend without having to make HTTP requests. Inertia.js uses Laravel's routing system to make the API calls.
